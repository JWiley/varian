\arguments{
\item{y.formula}{A formula describing a model for the outcome.  At present,
this must be a continuous, normally distributed variable.}

\item{v.formula}{A formula describing a model for the variability. Note
this must end with \code{ | ID}, where \code{ID} is the name of the
ID variable in the dataset.  At present, this must be a continuous,
normally distributed variable.}

\item{m.formula}{An optional formula decribing a model for a mediatior variable.
At present, this must be a continuous normally distributed variable.}

\item{data}{A long data frame containing an both the Level 2 and Level 1 outcomes,
as well as all covariates and an ID variable.}

\item{design}{A character string indicating the type of model to be run.  One of
\dQuote{V -> Y} for variability predicting an outcome,
\dQuote{V -> M -> Y} for mediation of variability on an outcome,
\dQuote{V} to take posterior samples of individual variability estimates alone.}

\item{useU}{A logical value whether the latent intercept estimated in Stage 1 should
also be used as a predictor.  Defaults to \code{TRUE}.  Note if there is a
mediator as well as main outcome, the latent intercepts will be used as a predictor
for both.}

\item{UQ}{A logical value whether the latent intercept estimated in Stage 1 should
also be used as a predictor with a qudratice effect.  Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
Note if there is a mediator as well as main outcome, the latent intercepts
will be used as a predictor for both.}

\item{IIVQ}{A logical value whether the latent variabilities estimated in Stage 1 should
also be used as a predictor with a qudratice effect.  Defaults to \code{FALSE}.
Note if there is a mediator as well as main outcome, the latent intercepts
will be used as a predictor for both.}

\item{centerU}{A numeric vector of length one (scalar) that is used to center the
latent intercept estimates before using as a predictor of the outcome / mediator.
Uses the formula: (U - centerU). Particularly useful when including quadratic terms.}

\item{centerIIV}{A numeric vector of length one (scalar) that is used to center the
latent variability estimates before using as a predictor of the outcome / mediator.
Uses the formula: (IIV - centerIIV). Particularly useful when including quadratic terms.}

\item{totaliter}{The total number of iterations to be used (not including the
warmup iterations), these are distributed equally across multiple independent
chains.}

\item{warmup}{The number of warmup iterations.  Each independent chain
has the same number of warmup iterations, before it starts the iterations
that will be used for inference.}

\item{chains}{The number of independent chains to run (default to 1).}

\item{inits}{Initial values passed on to \code{stan}.  If \code{NULL}, the default,
initial values are estimated means, standard deviations, and coefficients from a
single level linear regression.}

\item{modelfit}{A compiled Stan model (e.g., from a previous run).}

\item{autoDrop}{A logical argument whether to automatically drop IDs that have
no variability.  Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{opts}{A list giving options.  Currently only \code{SD_Tol} which controls
the tolerance for how small a variables standard deviation may be without
stopping estimation (this ensures that duplicate variables, or variables without
any variability are included as predictors).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{sampling}.}

\item{template_only}{A logical, not commonly used. If \code{TRUE} returns
the Stan template code only, without actually compiling or running the Stan model.
Useful for modifying the default models.}
}
\value{
A named list containing the model \code{results}, the \code{model},
  the \code{variable.names}, the \code{data}, the random \code{seeds},
  and the initial function \code{.call}.
}
\description{
This function uses a linear mixed effects model that assumes the level 1 residual
variance varies by Level 2 units.  That is rather than assuming a homogenous residual
variance, it assumes the residual standard deviations come from a Gamma distribution.
In the first stage of this model, each Level 2's residual standard deviation is
estimated, and in the second stage, these standard deviations are used to predict
another Level 2 outcome.  The interface uses an intuitive formula interface, but
the underlying model is implemented in Stan, with minimally informative priors for all
parameters.
